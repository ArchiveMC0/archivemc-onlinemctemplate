## On January 9th 2024, The OnlineMC repo and others have been DMCA striked by Mojang. This means OnlineMC will be gone forever along with the source code with it. But I found a fork of OnlineMC that I have to make it public.

Please go to the discord for bug reports.

## You can deploy on Oracle, Vercel, Render, Netlify, Heroku, Glitch, Amplify Console, IBM Cloud, and Google Cloud.
Connect your GitHub account because I do not know how to link deployment apps, sorry. If you wanna help me, you can!

# radmanplays deployment links have been removed from README because the original deploy link connected to radman is linked to OnlineMC before the DMCA.
